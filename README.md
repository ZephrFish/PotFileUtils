# PotFileUtils
This repo contains various utilities for manipulating the potfile in hashcat, the first two are for mapping the $HEX[] values to actual words and the second will parse your potfile and output to a wordlist. 

Inspired by a few utils that [John Carroll](https://twitter.com/TheContractorio) wrote in go initially.
